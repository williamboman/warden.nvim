# warden.nvim

> Enhanced diagnostics UI for Neovim. ðŸš§ Highly WIP. Publicly available to make it easier for me to clone.
> Aims to gracefully support multiple diagnostics sources (e.g. multiple LSP servers).

## Setup

```lua
vim.diagnostic.config {
    warden = {
        line_highlight = true,
    },
}
```

## TODO

### Right-aligned messages

As opposed to the builtin `virtual_text` handler, this will also merge diagnostics from multiple sources and display the
most severe one (the `virtual_text` handler only displays whichever diagnostic was received last). This will also
include an indicator symbol showing how many more diagnostics (and their severity) that have been truncated on a given
line.
